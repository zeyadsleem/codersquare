# PRD: Codersquare

Codersquare is a social web app for sharing learning resources in a
hackernews-style experience. It allows users to post links to articles, videos,
channels, or other public resources on the web, and other users to vote and
comment on those resources.

# Experience

## Post list

The site's landing page is a list of links, each link showing up with a title
that was given to it by the poster. Links are also given scores based on their
popularity and age, and are sorted as such.

Without signing in, users are able to browse this list and navigate to the
posted links. After signing in, users can also add comments to a post, upvote a
post, or add and delete their own posts.

## Tagging

A post can have a set of tags to describe its different attributes, usually
related to its topic. A special tag is added for the post's language (e.g.
Arabic), and users can filter the experience using those tags.

## Comments

Comments are sorted reverse-chronologically for any given post. Users are able
to delete their own comments.

# Market

This is a hybrid experience between news sites such as Hackernews or Reddit, and
learning sites that collect resources into a course-like experience such as
Coursera, Udemy, or FreeCodeCamp.
